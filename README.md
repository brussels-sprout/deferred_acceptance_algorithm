# deferred_acceptance_algorithm
The deferred acceptance algorithm, also known as the Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm, solves the stable marriage problem (different from the stable roomates problem).

Note that this currently (after it's finished) only solves the problem for two sets of elements of equal size.
